		<div>For once, Paul Johnson is running low on options.
After guiding his team to an 11-3 record and an Orange Bowl victory in 2014, the Georgia Tech football coach — known for his mastery of the triple-option rushing attack — watched five of his top six tailbacks graduate and his top two receivers ascended to the professional ranks.
But Johnson can still rely on his most important option of them all — junior quarterback Justin Thomas, who led the Yellow Jackets with 1,086 yards rushing a year ago.
“Justin is a tremendous athlete,” Johnson said. “He's got great quickness, he's really fast, he's got a quick release.
“He brings a different dimension to the game.”
Thomas — the NCAA’s third-leading rushing QB in 2014 — enters the season as a dark-horse Heisman Trophy candidate for the ACC Coastal preseason favorites. And with his explosiveness spearheading Johnson’s scheme, Thomas believes the Yellow Jackets’ unique attack will continue to pose problems for opposing defenses.
“You have to key on a variety of different things within our offense,” Thomas said. “You can't just key on one person that's going to run the ball.”
Georgia Tech’s fabled continuity remains on defense, where eight starters return from a lackluster group. But after communication breakdowns plagued the defense in 2014, senior cornerback D.J. White is hoping the veteran bunch can put it together this year.
“We got a lot of guys that are coming back from last year who kind of know what's going on,” he said. “It helps a lot knowing you can count on guys doing what they have to do.”Record: 11-3 (1st in Coastal)
Coach: Paul Johnson
Three key newcomers: Running back Patrick Skov (Stanford transfer), receiver Christian Philpott and defensive end Anree Saint-Amour
3 players to watch: Quarterback Justin Thomas, running back Broderick Snoddy and cornerback D.J. White
Key departures: Offensive guard Shaquille Mason, receiver DeAndre Smelter and running back Zach Laskey
Projected finish by media: 1st in Coastal
Biggest question mark: The Yellow Jackets return nearly their entire starting defense, but the experience comes from a unit that struggled mightily a year ago.
Biggest strength: Justin Thomas will look to capitalize on his breakout 2014 campaign, aided this year by a veteran offensive line.
When they play UNC: Oct. 3 at Georgia Tech
</div>
		<div>“After the North Carolina game a year ago, we turned to more pressure and decided we're going to get off the field one way or the other. Our guys kind of took to that and we played better on defense down the stretch.”
Coach Paul Johnson

		<div>Wake Forest had 2,595 yards of total offense in 2014, ranking them dead last out of 125 FBS teams.  
That’s fewer yards than six ACC quarterbacks managed to throw for a season ago.  It’s only eight yards more than Melvin Gordon rushed for in his senior season at Wisconsin.
In order to climb out of the ACC’s basement, the Demon Deacons enter 2015 looking for sophomore quarterback John Wolford and a host of other offensive players to significantly improve.
While Wolford managed to throw five touchdowns and just one interception over the final four games of the season, he struggled mightily during the season’s first half. Shaky offensive line and receiver also didn’t help Wolford or Wake Forest constantly futile offense.
Among the few bright spots for the Demon Deacons in 2014 was punter Alex Kinal, who finished fourth in the country in net punting average.  He helped Wake Forest allow only 5.9 yards per punt return.  
Second-year coach Dave Clawson will continue his rebuild of the program in 2015.  The Demon Deacons roster features 31 true freshmen.  
“We have six seniors on our whole football team,” Clawson said. “That’s the fewest since World War II. Seriously, since 1944.”
Clawson and Wake Forest fans have to hope that youth will eventually pay off and grow into impact players.
Last year’s record: 3-9 (1-7 ACC), 7th in Atlantic
Head coach: Dave Clawson
Projected finish by the media: 7th in Atlantic
3 key newcomers: Receiver Tabari Hines, running back Rocky Reid and defensive back Dionte Austin
3 players to watch: Linebacker Brandon Chubb, tight end Cam Serigne and safety Ryan Janvion
3 key departures: Cornerback Kevin Johnson, cornerback Bud Noel and receiver E.J. Scott
Biggest question mark: After throwing 12 touchdowns compared to 14 interceptions as a freshman, sophomore quarterback John Wolford will look to improve in 2015.
Biggest strength: Linebackers Nick Chubb, Hunter Williams and Marquel Lee form one of the most veteran units in the ACC.
When they play UNC: The Tar Heels host the Demon Deacons on Oct. 17
</div>
		<div>Wake Forest
</div>
		<div>“Are we going to go from where we were last year to averaging 45 points a game and 500 yards of offense? Probably not. But we need to make a good, solid, incremental jump.”
Coach Dave Clawson
</div>
		<div>The 2014 season was one filled with doubt for the Virginia Cavaliers. But if one thing is certain going into this season, it’s the starting quarterback job — Matt Johns is the guy.
That is if he doesn’t throw two interceptions for touchdowns in the first half of the season opener like former starting quarterback Greyson Lambert did in 2014. Lambert and Johns would compete for the starting job for the remainder of a subpar 5-7 season.
The year of competition might have been good for Johns, who is now a junior. Still, questions surround him with numerous injuries and departures on offense.
After graduating from North Carolina in 2014, former Tar Heel receiver T.J. Thorpe joined the Cavaliers as a target for Johns.  But after suffering a broken clavicle during training camp, Thorpe will remained sidelined until at least late October.
Fortunately for the Cavaliers, receiver Canaan Severin returns for his senior season after leading the team with 42 receptions for 578 yards and five touchdowns in 2014.
Carrying the ball, Virginia lost its two leading rushers — Kevin Parks and Khalek Shepherd — from a group that finished 13th in the ACC in rushing yards a season ago. This season, junior Taquan Mizzell and senior Darius Jennings are left to fill the void in the backfield.
With pieces constantly shuffling on Coach Mike London’s squad, Johns’ presence could help the team significantly. His experience from 2014, albeit limited, could prove crucial.
Last year’s record: 5-7 (3-5 ACC), 7th in Coastal
Head coach: Mike London
Projected finish by the media: 7th in Coastal
3 key newcomers: Quarterback Connor Brewer, linebacker C.J. Stalker and linebacker Jahvoni Simmons
3 players to watch: Quarterback Matt Johns, receiver Canaan Severin and running back Taquan Mizzell
3 key departures: Running back Kevin Parks, running back Khalek Shepherd and quarterback Greyson Lambert
Biggest question mark: With their two leading rushers gone, there is much work to be done for the Cavaliers to improve an already struggling backfield.
Biggest strength: Senior Ian Frye is arguably the best kicker in the country, finishing sixth in the NCAA with 22 made field goals in 2014. Frye was a Lou Groza semifinalist a season ago and enters 2015 on the preseason watch list for the award.

		<div>Pat Narduzzi left his post as the Michigan State defensive coordinator in December to take the reigns of the Pittsburgh Panthers and their potent offensive squad.And even though the Panthers finished 6-7 in 2014, punctuated by a loss in the Armed Forces Bowl, Narduzzi starts with two of the top offensive players in the ACC.
Among those scoring threats is 2014 ACC Player of the Year James Conner. Coming off a season that saw him rush for 1,765 yards and 26 touchdowns, the junior running back has found his name on several preseason award watch lists.
Narduzzi understands the amount of focus opposing defenses will give Conner after his eye-opening 2014 season, but said the junior will remain the focal point of the Panthers’ offensive attack.
“I’d hand him the ball off down here in Pinehurst and have him carry it back to Pittsburgh if I could,” said Narduzzi at ACC Football Kickoff in July. “We're going to give the guy the rock.”
Conner could find less room to run this year without offensive tackle T.J. Clemmings, who was drafted in the fourth round of the 2015 NFL Draft.
But helping to take pressure off Conner this season is junior receiver Tyler Boyd. A fellow All-ACC first-teamer in 2014, Boyd has delivered numerous highlight reel plays and solid production, becoming the first player in ACC history to record over 1,000 yards receiving as both a freshman and a sophomore.
The Panthers lost five games by five points or less in 2014, causing Narduzzi to preach the importance of finishing games.
Last season’s record: 6-7 (4-4 ACC), 4th in Coastal
Head coach: Pat Narduzzi
Projected finish by the media: 6th in Coastal
3 key newcomers: Defensive back Jordan Whitehead, linebacker Saleem Brightwell and defensive lineman Allen Edwards
3 players to watch: Running back James Conner, receiver Tyler Boyd and quarterback Chad Voytik
3 key departures: Linebacker Anthony Gonzalez, linebacker Todd Thomas and offensive tackle T.J. Clemmings
Biggest question mark: Pittsburgh lost two of their starting linebackers from 2014, leaving the Panthers with a hole to fill in the middle of their defense.
Biggest strength: Connor leads a running back group that also includes sophomore Chris James, who averaged more than five yards per rush on 87 carries in 2014.

		<div>Duke
</div>
		<div>“I like the hunger, and we focused on getting better in spring practice. It’s not about trying to win 9 games or 10 games. It’s just about, ‘How do we get better?’ It’s been fun to watch this team take that approach.” Coach David Cutcliffe
</div>
		<div>Since Anthony Boone became the starting quarterback at Duke in 2013, the Blue Devils have undergone a significant transformation, winning 19 games in the past two years.Throw in strong contributions from receiver Jamison Crowder, offensive tackle Takoby Cofield and offensive guard Laken Tomlinson, and one could see how the former bottom-dweller vaulted to the top of the ACC’s Coastal Division. But now, those pieces are gone. Without the key parts of their revitalization, Duke will rely on new faces on offense — namely junior quarterback Thomas Sirk and senior receiver Max McCaffrey — to maintain its recent success.But the offense isn’t the only side of the ball in need of a reconstruction.The defense took a blow when redshirt senior linebacker Kelby Brown suffered his fourth knee injury, effectively ending his career. He was a First-Team All-ACC performer in 2013 and missed the entire 2014 season while recovering from knee surgery.The Blue Devils return only one starter on their defensive line, but Duke’s secondary includes four players who have combined for 96 starts in their careers. The most important member of the defense is redshirt senior safety Jeremy Cash — a Second-Team All-ACC performer in 2014 — who enters the season as a preseason All-American.The Blue Devils’ offense, which averaged 32 points per game in 2014, will look dramatically different this year.But they’re hoping the production will stay the same.Last year’s record: 9-4 (5-3 ACC), 2nd in CoastalHead coach: David Cutcliffe
Projected finish by the media: 4th in Coastal
3 key newcomers: Receiver Aaron Young, linebacker Ben Humphreys and offensive tackle Reno Rosene
3 players to watch: Receiver Max McCaffrey, safety Jeremy Cash and tight end Braxton Deaver
3 key departures: Quarterback Anthony Boone, receiver Jamison Crowder and offensive guard Laken Tomlinson
Biggest question mark: After Boone passed for 5,789 yards in his career, junior quarterback Thomas Sirk will be tasked with running Duke’s offense.
Biggest strength: The Blue Devil secondary boasts five returning starters, led by preseason All-American Jeremy Cash.

		<div>Miami
</div>
		<div>During Coach Al Golden’s four-year stint at Miami, the program has produced several highly regarded NFL prospects. But he has yet to return the Hurricanes to the level of success the team enjoyed in the 1980s and early 2000s, putting his job future in jeopardy.Golden’s fifth season in charge is one where the Hurricanes need to see progress as a team. The bar in Miami is set higher than the 6-7 (3-5 ACC) mark the Hurricanes reached a season ago.The Hurricanes’ 2014 season was plagued by abysmal turnover numbers and held back by a fairly young roster. Entering 2015, the team has more experience, which is especially important for quarterback Brad Kaaya.Kaaya, who threw for 3,198 yards and 26 touchdowns in 2014, enters his sophomore year with more confidence and more familiarity with his offense.  The most promising part of the Hurricanes’ team is their loaded secondary. Junior defensive backs Artie Burns and Corn Elder look to improve on impressive sophomore seasons in 2014, while senior Deon Bush and redshirt senior Dallas Crawford add to Miami’s deep secondary.
Like the teams of the 80s and early 2000s, talent shouldn’t be a problem for the Hurricanes. The team had five players taken in the first three rounds of the 2015 NFL Draft, and that trend could continue with players like Kaaya and sophomore running back Joseph Yearby.  The biggest question is whether Golden can get the team to perform to its talent level and reach the lofty expectations associated with Miami football.
Last year’s record: 6-7 (3-5 ACC) 6th in Coastal
Head coach: Al GoldenPredicted finish by media: 3rd in Coastal
3 key newcomers: Running back Mark Walton, offensive guard Kendrick Norton and safety Jaquan Johnson
3 players to watch: Quarterback Brad Kaaya, running back Joseph Yearby and receiver Malcolm Lewis
3 key departures: Running back Duke Johnson, offensive guard Ereck Flowers and receiver Phillip Dorsett
Biggest Question Mark: Coaching. After a promising start, Golden regressed with a 6-7 record in 2014.  Expectations are for Miami to be one of the top programs in the country with the recruiting connections it has in South Florida.  
Biggest Strength: Quarterback Brad Kaaya enters the 2015 season after a stellar freshman campaign for the Hurricanes, where he finished second in the ACC in passing yards.

		<div>The Virginia Tech football team endured a roller-coaster season in 2014.
After reaching the pinnacle with victories over Duke and eventual national champion Ohio State, the Hokies plummeted back to earth following an overtime loss to Wake Forest, who finished the season with a woeful three wins.
Virginia Tech proved it could be successful at times, but sustaining said success was elusive — and injuries certainly didn’t help. 
The Hokies struggled to stay healthy in 2014, especially at the running back position, where Shai McKenzie and Marshawn Williams both had their freshman seasons cut short due to knee injuries. Even worse, McKenzie is now suspended for the season opener against Ohio State after he was charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a misdemeanor, in March. 

But with many of those players returning healthy this year, including defensive tackles Luther Maddy and Corey Marshall, Coach Frank Beamer is hopeful for an bump in wins this season. Beamer is also confident that despite the Hokies’ inconsistent skill players, a veteran offensive line will strengthen that side of the ball.
“To me, experience affects consistency a lot,” he said. “Not many freshmen going in their first time are going to grade 96 percent; it's going to be more like 76 percent.”
Newcomers like defensive tackle Tim Settle add depth to an already stacked defensive line that will prove a daunting challenge for opponents.Between injuries and team chemistry, Virginia Tech could never establish the stability it needed to win consistently in 2014.
The Hokies hope for a lot more ups than downs in 2015.</div>
		<div>Record last year: 7-6, (3-5 ACC), 5th in Coastal

3 players to watch: Defensive end Dadi Nicolas, cornerback Kendall Fuller and quarterback Michael Brewer
3 key departures: Center David Wang, safety Detrick Bonner and rover Kyshoen Jarrett
Biggest question mark: The Hokies will need redshirt senior Michael Brewer to elevate his game this season at the quarterback position. Brewer had only 18 touchdowns to go with 15 interceptions in his first season at Virginia Tech.  
Biggest strength: Virginia Tech returns three All-ACC performers from a year ago on the defensive line.

		<div>“The capabilities are there, but getting it to be efficient, getting it to be consistent, getting the chemistry right on the team is what challenges me.” Coach Frank Beamer
</div>
		<div>Jacoby Brissett isn’t a cheerleader.
N.C. State’s senior quarterback leads his young team by example. And as the first returning starting quarterback in Coach Dave Doeren’s three-year tenure, Brissett wants to build on the positives and negatives of last season — including a four-game losing streak midway through the season.
“One of the main things I will pride myself on is leading by example,” Brissett said. “I can just pull someone to the side, do it in a respectful way and try to ask them why before I jump on them.”
His leadership was an essential part of the Wolfpack’s growth a season ago, and it will be necessary to their success this year, too.
Improving from a 3-9 record in 2013 to an 8-5 record in 2014, the Wolfpack plans to continue that success by focusing on the little things. The team is approximately 70 percent freshmen and sophomores, Doeren said, but there are more returning players than there were in 2014.
“The big thing is just making the experience pay off now for the team,” Doeren said.
The Wolfpack have one of the weakest non-conference schedules in the country, but they will also face Florida State and Clemson.
“I think confidence carries over for sure,” Doeren said. “Momentum, I guess you know you’ll have that because of the way they’re feeling about themselves a little bit. But I think it’s more the confidence they have in their teammates, themselves.
“But you’ve gotta earn it all over again.”</div>
		<div>“(Brissett) is not a cheerleader, but he’s also not a guy that just leads by (example) — like Art Norman led by example and never talked. Jacoby talks. He talks when he needs to, and he’s not just negative and not just positive, he’s both. He says what he needs to say.” Coach David Doeren
</div>
		<div>Team record: 8-5 (3-5 ACC), 5th in the Atlantic
Head coach: Dave Doeren
Projected finish by the media: 4th in Atlantic
3 key newcomers: Running back/ receiver Nyheim Hines, running back Johnny Frasier and defensive end Darian Roseboro
3 players to watch: Quarterback Jacoby Brissett, running back Shadrach Thornton and safety Hakim Jones
Key departures: Receiver Bo Hines, receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling  and defensive end Art Norman.
Biggest question mark: The Wolfpack defense struggled against top offenses in 2014, allowing 30 or more points in each game during their four-game losing streak.
Biggest strength: N.C. State has a strong group of running backs returning and a versatile quarterback in Brissett. In 2014, the Wolfpack averaged 204.5 rushing yards per game — the team’s highest average since 1992.

</div>
		<div>“It wasn't like we didn't play well in the fourth quarter, but for whatever reason, we didn't make those three or four extra plays, which was the difference between seven wins, 10 wins or 11 wins. That’s something we're going to get done and pay close, close attention to.” Coach Steve Addazio
</div>
		<div>Despite its mascot known to soar through the air, Boston College is known for its ground-and-pound style of play.  
A player from Boston College has finished with impressive rushing totals in each of the past two seasons. In 2013, running back Andre Williams led all players with 2,177 yards, while quarterback Tyler Murphy finished second at his position in 2014 with 1,184 yards on the ground.  
This approach has taken the team to two straight bowl appearances.  Now, with a third straight bowl appearance in the crosshairs for the Eagles, the team turns to sophomore running back Jon Hilliman to continue the tradition set before him.  
Hilliman wowed as a freshman, rushing for 860 yards and 13 touchdowns. The burly 6-foot, 224 pounder will be counted on to carry the team to success this season.
Coach Steve Addazio, known for his defensive prowess, returns six starters on a defense that was 21st in points allowed in 2014 and 11th in total defense. On offense, however, Addazio must replace eight starters.  
“This year is a year that I really believe we have to play great defense because we're very young on offense,” Addazio said. “We're more athletic than we've been in the last couple years, but youth usually equates to mistakes. Mistakes equal inconsistency. Inconsistency brings about a lack of execution. That's the battle we're in right now.”
Sophomore Darius Wade will take over for Murphy at quarterback, while redshirt senior Harris Williams leads a young offensive line. Their performance, combined with the expected leap from Hilliman, should determine how high the Eagles fly this season.  
Last year’s record: 7-6 (4-4 ACC), 4th in AtlanticHead coach: Steve AddazioProjected finish by the media: 5th in Coastal3 key newcomers: Receiver Nolan Borgersen, defensive tackle Ray Smith and offensive tackle Anthony Palazzolo3 players to watch: Running back Jon Hilliman, quarterback Darius Wade and defensive back Justin Simmons3 key departures: Quarterback Tyler Murphy, linebacker Josh Keyes and offensive guard Bobby VardaroBiggest question mark: The offensive line is almost completely brand new and is crucial to the Eagles’ ability to move the ball.Biggest strength: The ground game should once again be strong for Boston College with Hilliman taking the lead role. Wade can also run the ball from the quarterback position.  When they play UNC: UNC will not play Boston College this season

3 players to watch: Quarterback Deshaun Watson, wide receiver Artavis Scott and defensive end Shaq Lawson
3 key departures: Defensive end Vic Beasley, linebacker Stephone Anthony and defensive tackle Grady Jarrett
Biggest question mark: In 2014, Clemson led the nation in total defense, ranking in the top-5 for both passing and rushing yards allowed. But their strength may now be a weakness with only three starters returning on the defensive side of the ball.
Biggest strength: The Tigers boast a talented receiving corps, including 2014 third-team All-ACC players Mike Williams and Artavis Scott. Complementing Williams and Bryant are redshirt graduate Charone Peake, who had two touchdown grabs in 2014, and incoming freshman Deon Cain.
When they play UNC: They do not play UNC</div>
		<div>With only 10 starters returning from the 2014 season — Clemson’s fewest since 2007 — the Tigers will hardly look the same in 2015.Add in the fact former offensive coordinator Chad Morris accepted the head-coaching position at Southern Methodist this offseason, and there has been a lot of turnover in Death Valley from last season.Despite all the change, no one is expecting Clemson to be an underdog this year. And with so much talent still on their roster, the Tigers don’t expect to be.The media still selected Clemson to win the conference. Five Tigers were chosen for the All-ACC Preseason Team, and sophomore quarterback Deshaun Watson was tabbed as Preseason ACC Player of the Year.In eight games during 2014, Watson threw 14 touchdowns, completed 67.9 percent of his passes and had a 188.6 passer rating. Returning All-ACC receivers Artavis Scott and Mike Williams combined for 133 receptions, 1,995 yards and 14 touchdowns.Defensively, Clemson will have to replace several positions. But junior defensive end Shaq Lawson – who had 11 tackles for loss and 3.5 sacks a season ago as a backup – was voted to the All-ACC Preseason Team. Holding down the fort in coverage will be redshirt sophomore cornerback Mackensie Alexander, who started all 13 games for Clemson in 2014 and played more snaps than any freshman in Clemson history.The Tigers will be hunted this season, and Coach Dabo Swinney knows it. That’s why he and the players have shifted their focus from their opponents.They aren’t playing 12 different teams this season — they are playing themselves.</div>

</div>
		<div>After a mass exodus from a 2014 squad that reached the College Football Playoff, the Florida State Seminoles are scrambling to find replacements at several key positions, most notably on the offensive side of the ball.
The Seminoles are without eight offensive starters from a season ago, including 2013 Heisman Trophy winner and first overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft Jameis Winston, tight end Nick O’Leary and leading receiver Rashad Greene.
But despite Florida State’s inexperience — especially on the offensive line — the Seminoles boast the top-ranked recruiting class in the ACC.
Freshmen defensive end Josh Sweat and safety Derwin James will look to improve a defense that struggled at times in 2014.  On offense, freshman running back Jacques Patrick will try to solidify the ground game while sophomore running back Dalvin Cook serves an indefinite suspension after he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery this offseason for punching a woman in the mouth outside of a bar.
Redshirt junior Sean Maguire is competing for the starting quarterback job with Everett Golson, a graduate transfer from Notre Dame. Both quarterbacks have their pros and cons; while Maguire has been in Coach Jimbo Fisher’s system for three years, Golson led the Fighting Irish to the BCS National Championship Game in 2013.
The one positional group expected to remain strong is the secondary, led by All-ACC junior defensive back Jalen Ramsey. The front seven is unproven but talented, aided by the return of senior linebacker Reggie Northrup and redshirt senior linebacker Terrance Smith from injuries.  
With a mix of veteran and younger players leading the charge, the new-look Seminoles will try to claim their fourth ACC Championship in as many years.
“We’re going to keep Florida State at a high standard,” Ramsey said. “We’re going to be at the top.”Record last season: 13-1 (8-0 ACC) 1st in Atlantic
Head coach: Jimbo Fisher
Projected finish by media: 2nd in Atlantic
3 key newcomers: Graduate transfer quarterback Everett Golson, freshman defensive back Derwin James and freshman running back Jacques Patrick
3 players to watch: Junior defensive back Jalen Ramsey, sophomore running back Dalvin Cook, sophomore receiver Travis Rudolph
3 key departures: Quarterback Jameis Winston, receiver Rashad Greene, defensive end Mario Edwards Jr.
Biggest question mark: The Seminoles lost four players on their offensive line who combined for 164 starts in their careers.
Biggest strength: Florida State returns five key members of their secondary, spearheaded by All-American defensive back Jalen Ramsey.

		<div>Scott Shafer is entering his third season as Syracuse’s head coach with more questions than answers.Among these questions is who will play at the quarterback position for the Orange in 2015.  Senior quarterback Terrel Hunt opened the 2014 season as the starter but had his season cut short due to injury. Sophomore AJ Long filled in during Hunt’s absence, throwing for just 935 yards and four touchdowns in six games.Syracuse also lost offensive coordinator George McDonald, who was demoted after five games and left for N.C. State following the season.  Shafer is a defensive guru, having served as Syracuse’s defensive coordinator for four seasons before being promoted in 2013 to head coach.But for the Orange to improve in 2015, Shafer will have to find a way to jumpstart the team’s offense. The team had a shot at a third consecutive bowl appearance but could not move the ball down the field, scoring in single digits in four of their nine losses.The other big question for the team is how to replace the talent lost on defense from a season ago. Eight starters from Syracuse’s defense — which ranked 26th nationally in 2014 — have moved on, leaving Shafer and the rest of his coaching staff searching for replacements.After an abysmal performance in 2014, questions still linger on both sides of the ball.How the Orange answers those questions will determine the course the season takes.

3 players to watch: Quarterback Terrel Hunt, receiver Steve Ishmael and running back George Morris II
3 key departures: Running back Prince-Tyson Gulley, offensive tackle Sean Hickey and linebacker Dyshawn Davis
Biggest question mark: If Syracuse is to have any success, it needs a consistent quarterback. There are a plethora of options, including Terrel Hunt, AJ Long and Eric Dungey. The team needs someone to step up and be a leader.
Biggest strength: The Orange have a lot of youth, which could lead to success in the future. If they can build on that now, then the future is bright.

		<div>Ten Louisville Cardinals were selected in the 2015 NFL Draft, shedding their red and white for the colors of their new professional team.
Now the Cardinals and Coach Bobby Petrino must adjust. 
In the second year of his second stint at Louisville, Petrino faces a tall task — replacing six starters on a defense that ranked No. 6 in the nation in 2014, three of his best pass catchers and three starting offensive linemen.
The Cardinals were aided in their quest in replacing their school-record 10 NFL draft picks by gaining a major addition over the offseason. Former Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year Devonte Fields and a pair of former Georgia Bulldogs have transferred to Louisville, which will look to bandage up an ailing secondary, respectively.On offense, Petrino looks to solidify the quarterback play from a season ago, when a rotating cast of three players took turns leading the huddle.The preseason favorite for the starting gig is sophomore Reggie Bonnafon, who will look to improve a Louisville offense that ranked No. 69 in the nation in 2014.
Bonnafon started five games in 2014. He ran for five touchdowns and had five passing touchdowns.

His 4-1 record as a starter was promising and included a crucial road win against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish.
Louisville will face two stiff challenges in the first three weeks of the season, playing Auburn in Georgia Dome before hosting Clemson in Week 3.
With the cards stacked against the Cardinals, Petrino and his young cast will look to solidify their status among the ACC elite in 2015.Last year’s record: 9-4 (5-3 ACC), 3rd in Atlantic
Head coach: Bobby Petrino
Predicted finish by the media: 3rd in Atlantic
3 key newcomers: Linebacker Devonte Fields, safety Josh Harvey-Clemmons and cornerback Shaq Wiggins
3 players to watch: Reciever James Quick, quarterback Reggie Bonnafon and running back Brandon Radcliff

		<div>“I think we should be as good. … We’re really strong on defense.”
Coach Bobby Petrino
</div>
		<div>For once, Paul Johnson is running low on options.
After guiding his team to an 11-3 record and an Orange Bowl victory in 2014, the Georgia Tech football coach — known for his mastery of the triple-option rushing attack — watched five of his top six tailbacks graduate and his top two receivers ascended to the professional ranks.
But Johnson can still rely on his most important option of them all — junior quarterback Justin Thomas, who led the Yellow Jackets with 1,086 yards rushing a year ago.
“Justin is a tremendous athlete,” Johnson said. “He's got great quickness, he's really fast, he's got a quick release.
“He brings a different dimension to the game.”
Thomas — the NCAA’s third-leading rushing QB in 2014 — enters the season as a dark-horse Heisman Trophy candidate for the ACC Coastal preseason favorites. And with his explosiveness spearheading Johnson’s scheme, Thomas believes the Yellow Jackets’ unique attack will continue to pose problems for opposing defenses.
“You have to key on a variety of different things within our offense,” Thomas said. “You can't just key on one person that's going to run the ball.”
Georgia Tech’s fabled continuity remains on defense, where eight starters return from a lackluster group. But after communication breakdowns plagued the defense in 2014, senior cornerback D.J. White is hoping the veteran bunch can put it together this year.
“We got a lot of guys that are coming back from last year who kind of know what's going on,” he said. “It helps a lot knowing you can count on guys doing what they have to do.”Record: 11-3 (1st in Coastal)
Coach: Paul Johnson
Three key newcomers: Running back Patrick Skov (Stanford transfer), receiver Christian Philpott and defensive end Anree Saint-Amour
3 players to watch: Quarterback Justin Thomas, running back Broderick Snoddy and cornerback D.J. White
Key departures: Offensive guard Shaquille Mason, receiver DeAndre Smelter and running back Zach Laskey
Projected finish by media: 1st in Coastal
Biggest question mark: The Yellow Jackets return nearly their entire starting defense, but the experience comes from a unit that struggled mightily a year ago.
Biggest strength: Justin Thomas will look to capitalize on his breakout 2014 campaign, aided this year by a veteran offensive line.

		<div>Wake Forest had 2,595 yards of total offense in 2014, ranking them dead last out of 125 FBS teams.  
That’s fewer yards than six ACC quarterbacks managed to throw for a season ago.  It’s only eight yards more than Melvin Gordon rushed for in his senior season at Wisconsin.
In order to climb out of the ACC’s basement, the Demon Deacons enter 2015 looking for sophomore quarterback John Wolford and a host of other offensive players to significantly improve.
While Wolford managed to throw five touchdowns and just one interception over the final four games of the season, he struggled mightily during the season’s first half. Shaky offensive line and receiver also didn’t help Wolford or Wake Forest constantly futile offense.
Among the few bright spots for the Demon Deacons in 2014 was punter Alex Kinal, who finished fourth in the country in net punting average.  He helped Wake Forest allow only 5.9 yards per punt return.  
Second-year coach Dave Clawson will continue his rebuild of the program in 2015.  The Demon Deacons roster features 31 true freshmen.  
“We have six seniors on our whole football team,” Clawson said. “That’s the fewest since World War II. Seriously, since 1944.”
Clawson and Wake Forest fans have to hope that youth will eventually pay off and grow into impact players.

Biggest question mark: After throwing 12 touchdowns compared to 14 interceptions as a freshman, sophomore quarterback John Wolford will look to improve in 2015.
Biggest strength: Linebackers Nick Chubb, Hunter Williams and Marquel Lee form one of the most veteran units in the ACC.

		<div>The 2014 season was one filled with doubt for the Virginia Cavaliers. But if one thing is certain going into this season, it’s the starting quarterback job — Matt Johns is the guy.
That is if he doesn’t throw two interceptions for touchdowns in the first half of the season opener like former starting quarterback Greyson Lambert did in 2014. Lambert and Johns would compete for the starting job for the remainder of a subpar 5-7 season.
The year of competition might have been good for Johns, who is now a junior. Still, questions surround him with numerous injuries and departures on offense.
After graduating from North Carolina in 2014, former Tar Heel receiver T.J. Thorpe joined the Cavaliers as a target for Johns.  But after suffering a broken clavicle during training camp, Thorpe will remained sidelined until at least late October.
Fortunately for the Cavaliers, receiver Canaan Severin returns for his senior season after leading the team with 42 receptions for 578 yards and five touchdowns in 2014.
Carrying the ball, Virginia lost its two leading rushers — Kevin Parks and Khalek Shepherd — from a group that finished 13th in the ACC in rushing yards a season ago. This season, junior Taquan Mizzell and senior Darius Jennings are left to fill the void in the backfield.
With pieces constantly shuffling on Coach Mike London’s squad, Johns’ presence could help the team significantly. His experience from 2014, albeit limited, could prove crucial.
Last year’s record: 5-7 (3-5 ACC), 7th in Coastal
Head coach: Mike London
Projected finish by the media: 7th in Coastal
3 key newcomers: Quarterback Connor Brewer, linebacker C.J. Stalker and linebacker Jahvoni Simmons
3 players to watch: Quarterback Matt Johns, receiver Canaan Severin and running back Taquan Mizzell
3 key departures: Running back Kevin Parks, running back Khalek Shepherd and quarterback Greyson Lambert
Biggest question mark: With their two leading rushers gone, there is much work to be done for the Cavaliers to improve an already struggling backfield.
Biggest strength: Senior Ian Frye is arguably the best kicker in the country, finishing sixth in the NCAA with 22 made field goals in 2014. Frye was a Lou Groza semifinalist a season ago and enters 2015 on the preseason watch list for the award.

		<div>Pat Narduzzi left his post as the Michigan State defensive coordinator in December to take the reigns of the Pittsburgh Panthers and their potent offensive squad.And even though the Panthers finished 6-7 in 2014, punctuated by a loss in the Armed Forces Bowl, Narduzzi starts with two of the top offensive players in the ACC.
Among those scoring threats is 2014 ACC Player of the Year James Conner. Coming off a season that saw him rush for 1,765 yards and 26 touchdowns, the junior running back has found his name on several preseason award watch lists.
Narduzzi understands the amount of focus opposing defenses will give Conner after his eye-opening 2014 season, but said the junior will remain the focal point of the Panthers’ offensive attack.
“I’d hand him the ball off down here in Pinehurst and have him carry it back to Pittsburgh if I could,” said Narduzzi at ACC Football Kickoff in July. “We're going to give the guy the rock.”
Conner could find less room to run this year without offensive tackle T.J. Clemmings, who was drafted in the fourth round of the 2015 NFL Draft.
But helping to take pressure off Conner this season is junior receiver Tyler Boyd. A fellow All-ACC first-teamer in 2014, Boyd has delivered numerous highlight reel plays and solid production, becoming the first player in ACC history to record over 1,000 yards receiving as both a freshman and a sophomore.
The Panthers lost five games by five points or less in 2014, causing Narduzzi to preach the importance of finishing games.
Last season’s record: 6-7 (4-4 ACC), 4th in Coastal
Head coach: Pat Narduzzi
Projected finish by the media: 6th in Coastal
3 key newcomers: Defensive back Jordan Whitehead, linebacker Saleem Brightwell and defensive lineman Allen Edwards
3 players to watch: Running back James Conner, receiver Tyler Boyd and quarterback Chad Voytik
3 key departures: Linebacker Anthony Gonzalez, linebacker Todd Thomas and offensive tackle T.J. Clemmings
Biggest question mark: Pittsburgh lost two of their starting linebackers from 2014, leaving the Panthers with a hole to fill in the middle of their defense.
Biggest strength: Connor leads a running back group that also includes sophomore Chris James, who averaged more than five yards per rush on 87 carries in 2014.

		<div>Since Anthony Boone became the starting quarterback at Duke in 2013, the Blue Devils have undergone a significant transformation, winning 19 games in the past two years.Throw in strong contributions from receiver Jamison Crowder, offensive tackle Takoby Cofield and offensive guard Laken Tomlinson, and one could see how the former bottom-dweller vaulted to the top of the ACC’s Coastal Division. But now, those pieces are gone. Without the key parts of their revitalization, Duke will rely on new faces on offense — namely junior quarterback Thomas Sirk and senior receiver Max McCaffrey — to maintain its recent success.But the offense isn’t the only side of the ball in need of a reconstruction.The defense took a blow when redshirt senior linebacker Kelby Brown suffered his fourth knee injury, effectively ending his career. He was a First-Team All-ACC performer in 2013 and missed the entire 2014 season while recovering from knee surgery.The Blue Devils return only one starter on their defensive line, but Duke’s secondary includes four players who have combined for 96 starts in their careers. The most important member of the defense is redshirt senior safety Jeremy Cash — a Second-Team All-ACC performer in 2014 — who enters the season as a preseason All-American.The Blue Devils’ offense, which averaged 32 points per game in 2014, will look dramatically different this year.But they’re hoping the production will stay the same.Last year’s record: 9-4 (5-3 ACC), 2nd in CoastalHead coach: David Cutcliffe
Projected finish by the media: 4th in Coastal
3 key newcomers: Receiver Aaron Young, linebacker Ben Humphreys and offensive tackle Reno Rosene
3 players to watch: Receiver Max McCaffrey, safety Jeremy Cash and tight end Braxton Deaver
3 key departures: Quarterback Anthony Boone, receiver Jamison Crowder and offensive guard Laken Tomlinson
Biggest question mark: After Boone passed for 5,789 yards in his career, junior quarterback Thomas Sirk will be tasked with running Duke’s offense.
Biggest strength: The Blue Devil secondary boasts five returning starters, led by preseason All-American Jeremy Cash.

		<div>During Coach Al Golden’s four-year stint at Miami, the program has produced several highly regarded NFL prospects. But he has yet to return the Hurricanes to the level of success the team enjoyed in the 1980s and early 2000s, putting his job future in jeopardy.Golden’s fifth season in charge is one where the Hurricanes need to see progress as a team. The bar in Miami is set higher than the 6-7 (3-5 ACC) mark the Hurricanes reached a season ago.The Hurricanes’ 2014 season was plagued by abysmal turnover numbers and held back by a fairly young roster. Entering 2015, the team has more experience, which is especially important for quarterback Brad Kaaya.Kaaya, who threw for 3,198 yards and 26 touchdowns in 2014, enters his sophomore year with more confidence and more familiarity with his offense.  The most promising part of the Hurricanes’ team is their loaded secondary. Junior defensive backs Artie Burns and Corn Elder look to improve on impressive sophomore seasons in 2014, while senior Deon Bush and redshirt senior Dallas Crawford add to Miami’s deep secondary.
Like the teams of the 80s and early 2000s, talent shouldn’t be a problem for the Hurricanes. The team had five players taken in the first three rounds of the 2015 NFL Draft, and that trend could continue with players like Kaaya and sophomore running back Joseph Yearby.  The biggest question is whether Golden can get the team to perform to its talent level and reach the lofty expectations associated with Miami football.  Last year’s record: 6-7 (3-5 ACC) 6th in Coastal
Head coach: Al Golden
Predicted finish by media: 3rd in Coastal
3 key newcomers: Running back Mark Walton, offensive guard Kendrick Norton and safety Jaquan Johnson
3 players to watch: Quarterback Brad Kaaya, running back Joseph Yearby and receiver Malcolm Lewis
3 key departures: Running back Duke Johnson, offensive guard Ereck Flowers and receiver Phillip Dorsett
Biggest question mark: Coaching. After a promising start, Golden regressed with a 6-7 record in 2014.  Expectations are for Miami to be one of the top programs in the country with the recruiting connections it has in South Florida.  
Biggest strength: Quarterback Brad Kaaya enters the 2015 season after a stellar freshman campaign for the Hurricanes, where he finished second in the ACC in passing yards.

		<div>The Virginia Tech football team endured a roller-coaster season in 2014.
After reaching the pinnacle with victories over Duke and eventual national champion Ohio State, the Hokies plummeted back to earth following an overtime loss to Wake Forest, who finished the season with a woeful three wins.
Virginia Tech proved it could be successful at times, but sustaining said success was elusive — and injuries certainly didn’t help. 
The Hokies struggled to stay healthy in 2014, especially at the running back position, where Shai McKenzie and Marshawn Williams both had their freshman seasons cut short due to knee injuries. Even worse, McKenzie is now suspended for the season opener against Ohio State after he was charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a misdemeanor, in March. 

But with many of those players returning healthy this year, including defensive tackles Luther Maddy and Corey Marshall, Coach Frank Beamer is hopeful for an bump in wins this season. Beamer is also confident that despite the Hokies’ inconsistent skill players, a veteran offensive line will strengthen that side of the ball.
“To me, experience affects consistency a lot,” he said. “Not many freshmen going in their first time are going to grade 96 percent; it's going to be more like 76 percent.”
Newcomers like defensive tackle Tim Settle add depth to an already stacked defensive line that will prove a daunting challenge for opponents.Between injuries and team chemistry, Virginia Tech could never establish the stability it needed to win consistently in 2014.
The Hokies hope for a lot more ups than downs in 2015.Record last year: 7-6, (3-5 ACC), 5th in Coastal
Head coach: Frank Beamer
Projected finish by the media: 2nd in Coastal
3 key newcomers: Defensive tackle Tim Settle, offensive lineman Austin Clark and cornerback Mook Reynolds
3 players to watch: Defensive end Dadi Nicolas, cornerback Kendall Fuller and quarterback Michael Brewer
3 key departures: Center David Wang, safety Detrick Bonner and rover Kyshoen Jarrett
Biggest question mark: The Hokies will need redshirt senior Michael Brewer to elevate his game this season at the quarterback position. Brewer had only 18 touchdowns to go with 15 interceptions in his first season at Virginia Tech.Biggest strength: Virginia Tech returns three All-ACC performers from a year ago on the defensive line.When they play UNC: The Tar Heels visit Virginia Tech on Nov. 21.</div>

3 players to watch: Quarterback Jacoby Brissett, running back Shadrach Thornton and safety Hakim Jones
Key departures: Receiver Bo Hines, receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling  and defensive end Art Norman.
Biggest question mark: The Wolfpack defense struggled against top offenses in 2014, allowing 30 or more points in each game during their four-game losing streak.
Biggest strength: N.C. State has a strong group of running backs returning and a versatile quarterback in Brissett. In 2014, the Wolfpack averaged 204.5 rushing yards per game — the team’s highest average since 1992.
When they play UNC: N.C. State hosts the Tar Heels on Nov. 28</div>
		<div>Jacoby Brissett isn’t a cheerleader.
N.C. State’s senior quarterback leads his young team by example. And as the first returning starting quarterback in Coach Dave Doeren’s three-year tenure, Brissett wants to build on the positives and negatives of last season — including a four-game losing streak midway through the season.
“One of the main things I will pride myself on is leading by example,” Brissett said. “I can just pull someone to the side, do it in a respectful way and try to ask them why before I jump on them.”
His leadership was an essential part of the Wolfpack’s growth a season ago, and it will be necessary to their success this year, too.
Improving from a 3-9 record in 2013 to an 8-5 record in 2014, the Wolfpack plans to continue that success by focusing on the little things. The team is approximately 70 percent freshmen and sophomores, Doeren said, but there are more returning players than there were in 2014.
“The big thing is just making the experience pay off now for the team,” Doeren said.
The Wolfpack have one of the weakest non-conference schedules in the country, but they will also face Florida State and Clemson.
“I think confidence carries over for sure,” Doeren said. “Momentum, I guess you know you’ll have that because of the way they’re feeling about themselves a little bit. But I think it’s more the confidence they have in their teammates, themselves.
“But you’ve gotta earn it all over again.”</div>
		<div>Despite its mascot known to soar through the air, Boston College is known for its ground-and-pound style of play.  
A player from Boston College has finished with impressive rushing totals in each of the past two seasons. In 2013, running back Andre Williams led all players with 2,177 yards, while quarterback Tyler Murphy finished second at his position in 2014 with 1,184 yards on the ground.  
This approach has taken the team to two straight bowl appearances.  Now, with a third straight bowl appearance in the crosshairs for the Eagles, the team turns to sophomore running back Jon Hilliman to continue the tradition set before him.  
Hilliman wowed as a freshman, rushing for 860 yards and 13 touchdowns. The burly 6-foot, 224 pounder will be counted on to carry the team to success this season.
Coach Steve Addazio, known for his defensive prowess, returns six starters on a defense that was 21st in points allowed in 2014 and 11th in total defense. On offense, however, Addazio must replace eight starters.  
“This year is a year that I really believe we have to play great defense because we're very young on offense,” Addazio said. “We're more athletic than we've been in the last couple years, but youth usually equates to mistakes. Mistakes equal inconsistency. Inconsistency brings about a lack of execution. That's the battle we're in right now.”
Sophomore Darius Wade will take over for Murphy at quarterback, while redshirt senior Harris Williams leads a young offensive line. Their performance, combined with the expected leap from Hilliman, should determine how high the Eagles fly this season.  
Last year’s record: 7-6 (4-4 ACC), 4th in AtlanticHead coach: Steve AddazioProjected finish by the media: 5th in Coastal3 key newcomers: Receiver Nolan Borgersen, defensive tackle Ray Smith and offensive tackle Anthony Palazzolo3 players to watch: Running back Jon Hilliman, quarterback Darius Wade and defensive back Justin Simmons3 key departures: Quarterback Tyler Murphy, linebacker Josh Keyes and offensive guard Bobby VardaroBiggest question mark: The offensive line is almost completely brand new and is crucial to the Eagles’ ability to move the ball.Biggest strength: The ground game should once again be strong for Boston College with Hilliman taking the lead role. Wade can also run the ball from the quarterback position.  When they play UNC: UNC will not play Boston College this season</div>
		<div>With only 10 starters returning from the 2014 season — Clemson’s fewest since 2007 — the Tigers will hardly look the same in 2015.Add in the fact former offensive coordinator Chad Morris accepted the head-coaching position at Southern Methodist this offseason, and there has been a lot of turnover in Death Valley from last season.Despite all the change, no one is expecting Clemson to be an underdog this year. And with so much talent still on their roster, the Tigers don’t expect to be.The media still selected Clemson to win the conference. Five Tigers were chosen for the All-ACC Preseason Team, and sophomore quarterback Deshaun Watson was tabbed as Preseason ACC Player of the Year.In eight games during 2014, Watson threw 14 touchdowns, completed 67.9 percent of his passes and had a 188.6 passer rating. Returning All-ACC receivers Artavis Scott and Mike Williams combined for 133 receptions, 1,995 yards and 14 touchdowns.Defensively, Clemson will have to replace several positions. But junior defensive end Shaq Lawson – who had 11 tackles for loss and 3.5 sacks a season ago as a backup – was voted to the All-ACC Preseason Team. Holding down the fort in coverage will be redshirt sophomore cornerback Mackensie Alexander, who started all 13 games for Clemson in 2014 and played more snaps than any freshman in Clemson history.The Tigers will be hunted this season, and Coach Dabo Swinney knows it. That’s why he and the players have shifted their focus from their opponents.They aren’t playing 12 different teams this season — they are playing themselves.</div>
		<div>Last year’s record: 10-3 (6-2 ACC), 2nd in Atlantic
Head coach: Dabo Swinney
Predicted finish by the media: 1st in Atlantic
3 key newcomers: Offensive tackle Mitch Hyatt, wide receiver Deon Cain and defensive tackle Christian Wilkins
3 players to watch: Quarterback Deshaun Watson, wide receiver Artavis Scott and defensive end Shaq Lawson
3 key departures: Defensive end Vic Beasley, linebacker Stephone Anthony and defensive tackle Grady Jarrett
Biggest Question Mark: In 2014, Clemson led the nation in total defense, ranking in the top-5 for both passing and rushing yards allowed. But their strength may now be a weakness with only three starters returning on the defensive side of the ball.
Biggest Strength: The Tigers boast a talented receiving corps, including 2014 third-team All-ACC players Mike Williams and Artavis Scott. Complementing Williams and Bryant are redshirt graduate Charone Peake, who had two touchdown grabs in 2014, and incoming freshman Deon Cain.
When they play UNC: They do not play UNC</div>
		<div>After a mass exodus from a 2014 squad that reached the College Football Playoff, the Florida State Seminoles are scrambling to find replacements at several key positions, most notably on the offensive side of the ball.
The Seminoles are without eight offensive starters from a season ago, including 2013 Heisman Trophy winner and first overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft Jameis Winston, tight end Nick O’Leary and leading receiver Rashad Greene.
But despite Florida State’s inexperience — especially on the offensive line — the Seminoles boast the top-ranked recruiting class in the ACC.
Freshmen defensive end Josh Sweat and safety Derwin James will look to improve a defense that struggled at times in 2014.  On offense, freshman running back Jacques Patrick will try to solidify the ground game while sophomore running back Dalvin Cook serves an indefinite suspension after he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery this offseason for punching a woman in the mouth outside of a bar.
Redshirt junior Sean Maguire is competing for the starting quarterback job with Everett Golson, a graduate transfer from Notre Dame. Both quarterbacks have their pros and cons; while Maguire has been in Coach Jimbo Fisher’s system for three years, Golson led the Fighting Irish to the BCS National Championship Game in 2013.
The one positional group expected to remain strong is the secondary, led by All-ACC junior defensive back Jalen Ramsey. The front seven is unproven but talented, aided by the return of senior linebacker Reggie Northrup and redshirt senior linebacker Terrance Smith from injuries.  
With a mix of veteran and younger players leading the charge, the new-look Seminoles will try to claim their fourth ACC Championship in as many years.
“We’re going to keep Florida State at a high standard,” Ramsey said. “We’re going to be at the top.”Record last season: 13-1 (8-0 ACC) 1st in Atlantic
Head coach: Jimbo Fisher
Projected finish by media: 2nd in Atlantic
3 key newcomers: Graduate transfer quarterback Everett Golson, freshman defensive back Derwin James and freshman running back Jacques Patrick
3 players to watch: Junior defensive back Jalen Ramsey, sophomore running back Dalvin Cook, sophomore receiver Travis Rudolph
3 key departures: Quarterback Jameis Winston, receiver Rashad Greene, defensive end Mario Edwards Jr.
Biggest question mark: The Seminoles lost four players on their offensive line who combined for 164 starts in their careers.
Biggest strength: Florida State returns five key members of their secondary, spearheaded by All-American defensive back Jalen Ramsey.
When they play UNC: They do not play UNC

		<div>Scott Shafer is entering his third season as Syracuse’s head coach with more questions than answers.Among these questions is who will play at the quarterback position for the Orange in 2015.  Senior quarterback Terrel Hunt opened the 2014 season as the starter but had his season cut short due to injury. Sophomore AJ Long filled in during Hunt’s absence, throwing for just 935 yards and four touchdowns in six games.Syracuse also lost offensive coordinator George McDonald, who was demoted after five games and left for N.C. State following the season.  Shafer is a defensive guru, having served as Syracuse’s defensive coordinator for four seasons before being promoted in 2013 to head coach.But for the Orange to improve in 2015, Shafer will have to find a way to jumpstart the team’s offense. The team had a shot at a third consecutive bowl appearance but could not move the ball down the field, scoring in single digits in four of their nine losses.The other big question for the team is how to replace the talent lost on defense from a season ago. Eight starters from Syracuse’s defense — which ranked 26th nationally in 2014 — have moved on, leaving Shafer and the rest of his coaching staff searching for replacements.After an abysmal performance in 2014, questions still linger on both sides of the ball.How the Orange answers those questions will determine the course the season takes.

Last year’s record: 3-9 (1-7 ACC), 6th in Atlantic

3 players to watch: Quarterback Terrel Hunt, receiver Steve Ishmael and running back George Morris II
3 key departures: Running back Prince-Tyson Gulley, offensive tackle Sean Hickey and linebacker Dyshawn Davis
Biggest question mark: If Syracuse is to have any success, it needs a consistent quarterback. There are a plethora of options, including Terrel Hunt, AJ Long and Eric Dungey. The team needs someone to step up and be a leader.
Biggest strength: The Orange have a lot of youth, which could lead to success in the future. If they can build on that now, then the future is bright.

		<div>Ten Louisville Cardinals were selected in the 2015 NFL Draft, shedding their red and white for the colors of their new professional team.
Now the Cardinals and Coach Bobby Petrino must adjust. 
In the second year of his second stint at Louisville, Petrino faces a tall task — replacing six starters on a defense that ranked No. 6 in the nation in 2014, three of his best pass catchers and three starting offensive linemen.
The Cardinals were aided in their quest in replacing their school-record 10 NFL draft picks by gaining a major addition over the offseason. Former Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year Devonte Fields and a pair of former Georgia Bulldogs have transferred to Louisville, which will look to bandage up an ailing secondary, respectively.On offense, Petrino looks to solidify the quarterback play from a season ago, when a rotating cast of three players took turns leading the huddle.The preseason favorite for the starting gig is sophomore Reggie Bonnafon, who will look to improve a Louisville offense that ranked No. 69 in the nation in 2014.
Bonnafon started five games in 2014. He ran for five touchdowns and had five passing touchdowns.

His 4-1 record as a starter was promising and included a crucial road win against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish.
Louisville will face two stiff challenges in the first three weeks of the season, playing Auburn in Georgia Dome before hosting Clemson in Week 3.
With the cards stacked against the Cardinals, Petrino and his young cast will look to solidify their status among the ACC elite in 2015.Last year’s record: 9-4 (5-3 ACC), 3rd in Atlantic
