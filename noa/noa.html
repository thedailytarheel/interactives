		<div>The University released its amended Notice of Allegations from the NCAA Monday. The NOA is a notice from the NCAA that tells the University what the agency’s investigation uncovered and the allegations stemming from it. The one released April 25 differed from the original notice sent last August on many fronts while repeating itself on other points.

		<div>The NCAA cited its sources — 18 instances in total — for the reason Boxill was alleged to have violated a bylaw,  but the other four violations do not have the same type of citation.
</div>
		<div>The NCAA cited the reports, emails and interviews that went into creating the allegations in the first notice.

		<div>112 documents and sources were involved in the creations of the amended NOA, said Director of Athletics Bubba Cunningham in a conference call.
</div>
		<div>252 documents were released by the University after reviewing and redacting protected information.

		<div>They were not mentioned. Instead, the NCAA calls the paper classes in the former department of African and Afro-American Studies “impermissible academic assistance."
</div>
		<div>They were alleged to have occurred during the academic-athletic scandal.

		<div>The NCAA leveraged five level 1 allegations against the University.

		<div>The NCAA leveraged five level 1 allegations against the University. The new notice still cites the University for a lack of institutional control, but the impermissible benefits charge has been renamed. 
</div>
		<div>According to the first NOA, the inappropriate relationship began in the fall semester of 2002. The Wainstein report says the fraudulent classes began in 1993.
</div>
		<div>According to the most recent NOA, the inappropriate relationship began in the fall semester of 2005 — three years before the first notice.
