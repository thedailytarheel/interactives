Housing: He thinks we need to more adequately address the breadth of our housing challenges, including rental housing for very low-wealth residents, low-wealth seniors, and persons with disabilities and that we also need to more effectively explore the possibilities for manufactured housing and the challenges that residents of that housing now face reaching these diverse communities.
School Systems: He demands that all school children in the county have access to equal educational opportunities and thinks we need to more effectively link the school districts’ education policies to other county priorities, particularly as they relate to the needs of low wealth children.
