		<div>The Wainstein Report: One year later</div>
		<div>Academic employees</div>
		<div>Athletic employees</div>
		<div>One year after the release of Kenneth Wainstein’s eight-month-long investigation, questions remain. In Wainstein’s report, there are 31 current University employees named or quoted, not including Section IV of the report that summarizes all interviews conducted by the Wainstein’s team. 

The Daily Tar Heel has compiled all 31 employees here and asked each individual his or her opinion of the report and of the University’s response.

What Wainstein said about him: The report states Blanton directed some of his players to paper classes when he was a counselor for several Olympic sports teams, including the women’s soccer team. Blanton also suggested to longtime women’s soccer head coach Anson Dorrance that he use the paper classes to help recruit top players to Chapel Hill.
"For example, on one occasion, Blanton specifically suggested that Dorrance mention Crowder, and the past use of 'AFAM/AFRI independent study courses' by women’s soccer players, while communicating with a potential recruit,” one footnote read. 

What he said about the report:

What Wainstein said about him: Orr knew the classes existed and did not require attendance, the report said, but claimed he did not know how the classes were conducted.
