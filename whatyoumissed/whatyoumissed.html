		<div>North Carolina remained one of the top five states for migration in 2015, though the state slipped from third-most migration in 2013-14 to fifth-most in 2015.Economists think migration to North Carolina is motivated by business and an increased desire for outdoor activity and green regions, with the aging baby boomer population seeking warmer climates.North Carolina remains the ninth-most populous state in the union and breached the 10 million population marker during 2015, spurred largely by the growth of Raleigh and Charlotte.

		<div>Chase Dining Hall — often referred to as Rams Head — is undergoing renovations to expand food services for the fall 2016 semester.Existing large meeting rooms and other office spaces totaling about 5,028 square feet on the second floor of Chase Dining Hall will be converted into food service and seating areas as an extension of the dining program on the first floor. A new stairway will provide direct access to the main dining areas on the first floor, and restrooms will become more accessible.The renovations are a part of a series of capital improvement projects recently authorized by the Board of Governors at schools across the UNC system. The project is estimated to cost $3,850,000, paid for with dining receipts. It is expected to be completed by August 2016.

		<div>Protesters disrupt BOG
</div>
		<div>Students, faculty and community members confronted the UNC-system Board of Governors during the last board meeting of 2015, demanding the dismissal of President-elect Margaret Spellings.The Dec. 11 meeting at the UNC Center for School Leadership Development in Chapel Hill included the full board, and former President Tom Ross gave his final briefing before stepping Jan. 3.“Whatever lies ahead, I urge you to never permit this magnificent state asset — this treasure that truly belongs to the people of North Carolina — to be diminished,” he told board members.Members of Faculty Forward North Carolina and the UNC-Chapel Hill BOG Democracy Coalition were among the protesters, who eventually moved inside the building shortly before the meeting began at 9 a.m.Several board members were disgruntled at the interruption. Chairperson Lou Bissette threatened to kick the protesters out.“UNC deserves better," said UNC-Chapel Hill senior Alli Clayton, who came to the protest with a group of friends. “I hope that not only Margaret Spellings, but the Board of Governors realize that we’re actually paying attention to things that are going on, that we actually care and that we actually have power.”

		<div>Gun control excutive order
</div>

House Speaker Paul Ryan predicted the measure would be held unconstitutional by the courts and several GOP presidential hopefuls have promised to overturn the measures.

His 39-point, 23-rebound performance against Florida State on Jan. 4 made him the second player in school history to accomplish the feat.</div>
		<div>After dropping three of its first seven games by one possession, the North Carolina women's basketball team (12-6, 2-1 ACC) ripped off six straight victories — including three by five or fewer points — before losing to Notre Dame to close out the holiday season.The season-long winning streak culminated in a come-from-behind win over Syracuse, which led UNC 10-0 before the Tar Heels mounted their comeback.First-year guard Stephanie Watts and sophomore guard Jamie Cherry shared the scoring load throughout the break, as one of the two perimeter threats led UNC in points in eight of the past nine games.

		<div>Volleyball
</div>
		<div>The North Carolina volleyball team capped its 2015 season with a 3-1 loss (32-30, 18-25, 18-25, 14-25) to Creighton in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.The Tar Heels (21-10, 17-3 ACC) won 12 consecutive matches to end the regular season, which helped the team secure its sixth straight 20-win campaign and a chance to host the first and second rounds of the NCAA Tournament.UNC swept UNC-Wilmington 3-0 (25-18, 25-21, 25-21) in the first round of the NCAA Tournament before falling to the 16th-seeded Bluejays.

		<div>LDOC lockdown
</div>
		<div>On Dec. 2, the last day of classes for the fall semester, UNC went into lockdown after someone called 911 and said they saw a man with a rifle entering the ROTC Armory building on campus. No armed person was found after a number of police agencies searched South Columbia Street for suspicious activity, and the lockdown ended after less than half an hour.
The armory is kept locked and does contain active and inactive weapons, including parade rifles, UNC officials said. Police investigated a separate incident the same morning across campus, which turned out to be a homeowner shooting an air rifle on private property.
